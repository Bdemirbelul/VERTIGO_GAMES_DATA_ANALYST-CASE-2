# VERTIGO_GAMES_DATA_ANALYST-CASE-2



In this analysis, I used the dataset containing daily user activities to better understand player behavior. I began by examining how users behaved on their first day after installing the game, creating a first-day engagement segmentation. To do this, I combined metrics such as session count, total playtime, match starts/finishes, win rate, and first-day generated revenue. Using these metrics, I built an individual behavioral profile for each user and then applied K-Means clustering to segment them into three main groups: low, medium, and high engagement. These segments helped identify how quickly players adapt to the game and made it possible to detect high-potential users early on.

After segmentation, I analyzed how player activity changes over time by looking at daily and days-since-install trends in average session duration. The goal was to observe whether session lengths increased as users became more engaged or shortened as they lost interest. I also examined retention rates, monetization patterns (IAP & Ad Revenue), behavioral differences between payers and non-payers, and country-level performance to gain a broader understanding of player behavior within the dataset.

Finally, I analyzed session behavior across different stages of the user lifecycle, revealing clear patterns between newly onboarded players and long-term users. This insight helped me understand how the game influences long-term engagement and player loyalty.
